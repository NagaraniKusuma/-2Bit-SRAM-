The 2-bit Synchronous RAM is a small memory unit capable of storing 2 bits of data, typically organized as 1 word of 2 bits or 2 words of 1 bit each. It operates in synchronization with a clock signal, meaning all read and write operations occur on the rising or falling edge of the clock. The module includes inputs for address selection, data input, write enable, and a clock, along with a data output port. When the write enable is active, the data at the input is written to the selected address on the triggering clock edge. When write enable is low, the RAM performs a read operation, outputting the data stored at the addressed location.
